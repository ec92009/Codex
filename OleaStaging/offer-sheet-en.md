# OLEA STAGING
## One-Page Offer Sheet (Malaga - Marbella)

### Who This Is For
Real-estate agencies and independent agents listing residential properties in the Malaga-Marbella corridor.

### Core Problem
Many listings underperform because visual presentation is weak: flat photos, poor lighting, or rooms that feel empty/confusing online.

### What We Deliver
A fast, repeatable visual-upgrade service that helps your listings:
- Get more qualified inquiries
- Look premium vs. competing listings
- Reduce time-on-market pressure

### Service Model (4 Stages)

#### Stage 1: Existing Photos Cleanup
- We use the agent's current listing photos
- Professional edit: light/HDR correction, straight lines, color balance
- Fast upgrade without a new shoot

#### Stage 2: New On-Site Photo Shoot
- We go on-site and take new photos (up to 90 minutes)
- 20-30 professionally edited images
- The owner/agent is responsible for preparing and presenting the property before the shoot

#### Stage 3: Virtual Staging
- We create virtually staged versions of key rooms
- Style matched to target buyer profile
- Before/after files included for listing portals and social media

#### Stage 4: Physical Staging + Photo Shoot
- We coordinate actual in-person staging of the property
- We photograph the fully staged result
- Premium package for high-value or hard-to-sell listings
