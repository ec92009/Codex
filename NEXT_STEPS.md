# Next Steps

Use this file as a quick checkpoint before stopping work.

## Current Task

- Continue Olea Media Co content + site variant refinement, then package updated outreach assets.

## Last Completed

- Pushed `bdd4dd0` - `Keep Olea Media Co PDFs single-page with image strip`
- Embedded real before/after images and aligned visuals across web variants and PDFs

## Next Command To Run

- `cd /Users/ecohen/Codex/OleaMediaCo/site && python3 -m http.server 8000`
- Open `http://localhost:8000` to review `v1`-`v5` variants side-by-side

## Open Questions

- Which variant (`v1`-`v5`) should be promoted as the default outreach landing page?
- Are we finalizing copy in English only first, or syncing EN/ES/FR together on each change?

## Blockers

- No technical blockers currently.
- Main dependency is copy/design selection for the next iteration.

## Resume Checklist

- Run `git -C /Users/ecohen/Codex status --short --branch`
- Run `git -C /Users/ecohen/Codex log --oneline -5`
- Review this file and update/remove stale items
- Continue with the next command above
