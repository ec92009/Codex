      <h2>Who I am</h2>
      <p><strong>I believe tax strategy should be intentional, not reactive.</strong></p>
      <p>
        I'm a licensed CPA with nearly a decade of experience advising entrepreneurs, multi-entity businesses, and growing founders.
        I've worked inside established firms where I learned both what excellent advisory looks like and where traditional processes can fall short.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, I saw how messy workflows, reactive deadlines, and fragmented communication often distracted from what clients actually needed:
        clarity, structure, and thoughtful strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I founded Olea Tax Co to work differently.
        Here, I work directly with each client to reduce tax exposure, improve entity structure, and ensure business decisions are made intentionally and not rushed at year-end.
        My approach is proactive, structured, and built around long-term thinking.
