        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p><strong>I believe tax strategy should be intentional, not reactive.</strong></p>
        <p>
          I'm a licensed CPA with nearly a decade of experience advising entrepreneurs, multi-entity businesses, and growing founders.
          I've worked inside established firms where I learned both what excellent advisory looks like and where traditional processes can fall short.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, I saw how messy workflows, reactive deadlines, and fragmented communication often distracted from what clients actually needed:
          clarity, structure, and thoughtful strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I founded Olea Tax Co to work differently.
          Here, I work directly with each client to reduce tax exposure, improve entity structure, and ensure business decisions are made intentionally and not rushed at year-end.
          My approach is proactive, structured, and built around long-term thinking.
